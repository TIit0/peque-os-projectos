# Dev Challenge 1


my first dev challenge ever

## Process:

Sass was overkill

- yeah, i know it was not needed at all, but i wanted to practice, and hey, i learned Sass can bee obstructive on micro projecs.


2. How i did it

- I was still trying to understand the basics of css and it's foundations, flexbox, grid, etc. so it took me a few attempts while i was learning how to get things done. i may have started with flex, or grid haha i don't remember and switched to the otherone, it was geat for taking the first steps. i learned a lot
